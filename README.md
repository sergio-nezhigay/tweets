# Tweet User Cards App

## Description

Welcome to our project! This is a Tweet User Cards App made in JS and React.
This application allows you to view user cards, displaying information such as
the user's photo, the number of their tweets, and the number of their followers.
Additionally, it provides functionality to add yourself as a follower of a

clicking the button, its appearance changes, and the follower count increases in
