# Tweet User Cards App

## Description

Welcome to our project! This is a Tweet User Cards App made in JS and React.
This application allows you to view user cards, displaying information such as
the user's photo, the number of their tweets, and the number of their followers.
Additionally, it provides functionality to add yourself as a follower of a
specific user. This can be achieved by clicking the "Follow" button. Upon
clicking the button, its appearance changes, and the follower count increases in
the counter.

4. The button appearance will change to indicate that you are now following the
   user.
5. The follower count will increase by one in the counter.
