          On the home page, you'll find an exciting collection of user cards,
          each representing a unique user. These cards showcase their profile
          photo, tweet count, and follower count. Take a moment to browse
          through the diverse set of users and get a glimpse into their online
          presence.

          locate the user card you want to follow, click the{' '}
          <FollowButton>Follow</FollowButton> button, and voila! You've just
          added yourself as a follower. The button will magically transform,

          If you ever change your mind or want to adjust your follower list,
          fear not! Our app makes it a breeze to unfollow a user. Simply click
          the <FollowButton>Unfollow</FollowButton> button now, and just like
          that, you're no longer a follower. The button will gracefully return
          to its original state, and the follower count will adjust accordingly.
